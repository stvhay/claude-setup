### Free & Combined Chlorine (FAS-DPD Titration)

**Most accurate chlorine test available.**

#### Sample Size Options
| Sample Size | Drop Value | Use When |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| 25 mL | 1 drop = 0.2 ppm | Normal testing (more precision) |
| 10 mL | 1 drop = 0.5 ppm | High chlorine levels |

#### Procedure

1. **Fill** large comparator tube to desired mark (25 mL or 10 mL)
2. **Add** 2 dippers R-0870 powder, swirl until dissolved
   - If FAC present → sample turns pink
   - If pink disappears → add more R-0870 until pink holds
3. **Titrate** with R-0871 dropwise, swirling after each drop
   - Count drops until color changes pink → colorless
4. **Calculate FAC**: drops × drop value = ppm Free Chlorine
5. **Add** 5 drops R-0003, swirl to mix
   - If combined chlorine present → sample turns pink again
6. **Titrate** with R-0871 dropwise until colorless
7. **Calculate CC**: drops × drop value = ppm Combined Chlorine

**Example (25 mL sample):**
- Step 4: 15 drops × 0.2 = 3.0 ppm FAC
- Step 7: 2 drops × 0.2 = 0.4 ppm CC
- TAC = FAC + CC = 3.4 ppm

### pH Test (Color Comparator)

1. **Fill** large comparator tube to 44 mL mark
2. **Add** 5 drops R-0004
3. **Cap** and invert to mix
4. **Match** color with color standard on comparator block
   - If between two values, pH is the average

**Color Chart:**
| Color | pH |
|-------|-----|
| Yellow | 7.0 |
| Yellow-Orange | 7.2 |
| Orange | 7.4 |
| Orange-Red | 7.6 |
| Red | 7.8 |
| Red-Purple | 8.0 |

### Total Alkalinity Test

1. **Fill** large comparator tube to 25 mL mark
2. **Add** 2 drops R-0007, swirl
3. **Add** 5 drops R-0008, swirl → sample turns green
4. **Titrate** with R-0009 dropwise, swirling after each
   - Count drops until color changes green → red
5. **Calculate**: drops × 10 = ppm Total Alkalinity

**High TA Procedure** (if expecting >200 ppm):
- Use 10 mL sample
- Add 1 drop R-0007, 3 drops R-0008
- Multiply drops by 25

---

### Calcium Hardness Test

1. **Fill** large comparator tube to 25 mL mark
2. **Add** 20 drops R-0010 (or fill pipet to 1 mL), swirl
3. **Add** 5 drops R-0011L, swirl
   - If CH present → sample turns red
4. **Titrate** with R-0012 dropwise, swirling after each
   - Count drops until color changes red → blue
5. **Calculate**: drops × 10 = ppm Calcium Hardness

**High CH Procedure** (if expecting >400 ppm):
- Use 10 mL sample
- Add 10 drops R-0010 (or 0.5 mL), 3 drops R-0011L
- Multiply drops by 25

### Cyanuric Acid Test (Turbidity)

1. **Fill** CYA dispensing bottle (#9191) to 7 mL mark
2. **Add** R-0013 to 14 mL mark
3. **Cap** and mix for 30 seconds
4. **Transfer** cloudy solution slowly to small comparator tube
   - Stop when black dot on bottom just disappears (viewed from top)
5. **Read** tube at liquid level on back of comparator block
6. **Record** as ppm Cyanuric Acid

**Note:** CYA test is less precise than titration tests. ±10 ppm is normal.

### Sodium Chloride (Salt) Test

1. **Fill** sample tube (#9198) to 10 mL mark
2. **Add** 1 drop R-0630, swirl → sample turns yellow
3. **Titrate** with R-0718 dropwise, swirling after each
   - Count drops until color changes yellow → milky salmon/brick red
   - **Stop at first color change** (do not over-titrate to brown)
4. **Calculate**: drops × 200 = ppm Salt (sodium chloride)

**Example:** 9 drops × 200 = 1,800 ppm salt

## Hanna Checker Procedures

### HC-HI701 Free Chlorine Checker

**Specifications:**
- Range: 0.00 - 2.50 ppm
- Resolution: 0.01 ppm  
- Accuracy: ±0.03 ppm ±3% of reading

**Procedure:**
1. **Press** ON/OFF button - display shows "Add", "C.1" with "Press" blinking
2. **Fill** cuvette with 10 mL of unreacted sample, replace cap
3. **Insert** cuvette into checker, close cap
4. **Press** ON/OFF button - when "Add", "C.2" with "Press" shows, checker is zeroed
5. **Remove** cuvette, unscrew cap
6. **Add** content of one packet HI701-0 Free Chlorine reagent
7. **Replace** cap and shake gently for 20 seconds
8. **Insert** cuvette, close cap
9. **Press and hold** ON/OFF (or wait 1 minute and press)
10. **Read** free chlorine concentration in ppm

**Error Messages:**
- **Light High**: Excess ambient light - check zero cuvette
- **Light Low**: Not enough light - check zero cuvette
- **Inverted Cuvettes**: Swap cuvettes and repeat
- **Under Range** (blinking 0.00): Sample absorbs less than zero reference
- **Over Range** (blinking max): Dilute sample and repeat

### HC-HI711 Total Chlorine Checker

**Specifications:**
- Range: 0.00 - 3.50 ppm
- Resolution: 0.01 ppm
- Accuracy: ±0.03 ppm ±3% of reading

**Procedure:**
Same as HI701, except:
- Use HI711-0 Total Chlorine reagent packet
- Wait time is 2 minutes 30 seconds (longer than FAC)

**Combined Chlorine** = TAC reading - FAC reading

**General Tips:**
- Do not let reacted sample stand too long - affects accuracy
- Discard sample immediately after reading to prevent staining
- Replace reagents annually

## Apera PH60 pH Meter Procedures

**Specifications:**
- Range: -2.00 to 16.00 pH
- Resolution: 0.01 pH
- Accuracy: ±0.01 pH
- Auto Temperature Compensation: 0-50°C

### Before First Use
1. Remove storage cap (contains 3M KCl solution)
2. Soak probe in 3M KCl for 5-15 minutes if dried out
3. Perform calibration

### Calibration (Weekly or as needed)
1. **Rinse** probe with distilled water, shake dry
2. **Immerse** in pH 7.00 buffer (at least 1")
3. **Press** CAL button
4. **Wait** for stability icon to appear
5. **Press** ENTER to confirm pH 7 point
6. **Rinse** probe with distilled water
7. **Immerse** in pH 4.01 buffer
8. **Wait** for stability, **Press** ENTER
9. **Rinse** and return to 3M KCl storage

**Calibration Tips:**
- Always calibrate pH 7 first
- Use fresh, room-temperature buffers
- Store buffers sealed when not in use

### Taking a Reading
1. **Remove** storage cap
2. **Rinse** probe with distilled water, shake dry
3. **Immerse** probe at least 1" in sample
4. **Stir** gently to remove air bubbles
5. **Wait** for reading to stabilize (10-30 seconds)
6. **Record** pH value
7. **Rinse** probe with distilled water
8. **Replace** storage cap with 3M KCl solution

### Critical Storage Requirements
- **NEVER** store probe in pure water (tap, RO, distilled, deionized)
- Pure water damages the pH probe reference junction
- If accidentally stored in pure water: soak in 3M KCl overnight, then recalibrate
- Probe life: 1-2 years with proper care

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Won't calibrate | Pressing too soon | Wait for stability icon |
| Won't calibrate | Dried probe | Soak in 3M KCl 30+ min |
| Won't calibrate | Old probe | Replace probe |
| Reading unstable | Contaminated probe | Clean with probe solution |
| Reading unstable | Clogged junction | Soak in 3M KCl overnight |
| Always reads 7.0 | Broken probe | Replace probe |

## Troubleshooting Test Results

### Chlorine Test Issues
- **No pink color with R-0870**: FAC is zero or very low
- **Pink fades immediately**: Chlorine demand present; add more R-0870
- **Endpoint unclear**: Sample may be dirty; filter through coffee filter

### pH Test Issues
- **Color doesn't match chart**: pH is extreme (<7.0 or >8.0)
- **Color is muddy**: High metals in water; use Apera meter instead

### CYA Test Issues
- **Dot never disappears**: CYA is very high (>100 ppm)
- **Dot disappears immediately**: CYA is very low (<30 ppm)
