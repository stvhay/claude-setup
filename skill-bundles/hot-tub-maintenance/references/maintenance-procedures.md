# Maintenance Procedures - Hotspring Flair

## Drain and Refill Procedure

### When to Drain
- Every 12 months with salt system (3-4 months without)
- Persistent foam that won't resolve
- CYA buildup >100 ppm
- Biofilm/algae that survived treatment
- Switching water care systems

### Equipment Needed
- Garden hose
- Soft cloth or sponge
- FreshWater Spa Shine (optional)
- Clean Screen pre-filter (recommended)
- Filter cleaner
- Fresh filters (optional)

### Step-by-Step

**Phase 1: Drain**
1. Turn off both GFCI breakers in subpanel
2. Remove equipment compartment door for access
3. Locate drain valve below front panel
4. Remove drain cap
5. Attach garden hose inlet to drain valve
6. Route hose to appropriate drain area (not on plants if chlorine present)
7. Open valve by turning knob
8. Allow complete gravitational drain (~20-30 min)

**Phase 2: Clean**
1. Wipe shell with soft cloth and plain water
2. For stubborn residue: use FreshWater Spa Shine or Soft Scrub only
3. **Never use**: Simple Green, Windex, alcohol, abrasives
4. Rinse thoroughly with fresh water
5. Wipe down pillows; remove and store if heavily soiled
6. Clean filter compartment

**Phase 3: Filter Service**
1. Remove filter cartridges (turn retainer counterclockwise)
2. Soak in filter cleaner per product instructions (usually overnight)
3. Rinse thoroughly with garden hose
4. Inspect for damage; replace if pleats are torn or collapsed
5. Rotate filters to different positions on reinstall

**Phase 4: Refill**
1. Close drain valve
2. Reinstall drain cap
3. Attach Clean Screen pre-filter to hose (recommended)
4. Insert hose into filter compartment
5. Fill until water reaches 1" above highest jet (just below pillow)
6. **Do not fill with water <50°F** - can trip high limit
7. Remove hose, reinstall filter compartment cover

**Phase 5: Startup**
1. Secure equipment compartment door
2. Reset 30A GFCI breaker first
3. Verify system primes (listen for circulation pump)
4. Reset 20A GFCI breaker
5. Check jet operation: press JETS, then JET MAX, run 1 minute
6. Turn diverter through both positions to purge air
7. Open air control lever fully (clockwise)

**Phase 6: Chemistry**
1. Set output level to 0 (system off during balancing)
2. Add salt: ~8 cups for fresh fill, through filter compartment with jets on
3. Wait 5 min for salt to dissolve
4. Test salt with strip; adjust to 1,750 ppm
5. Test and adjust TA to 80 ppm (bicarbonate to raise, bisulfate to lower)
6. Test and adjust pH to 7.4 (carbonate to raise, bisulfate to lower)
7. Shock to 5 ppm FAC with dichlor (~4 tsp)
8. Set output level to 6
9. Run clean cycle through both diverter positions
10. Cover and wait 24h

**Phase 7: Confirm**
1. After 24h, test FAC - should maintain ≥3 ppm
2. If <3 ppm, shock again and enable Boost
3. Repeat daily until system maintains 3 ppm independently
4. Ready for use

## Filter Cleaning (Monthly)

### Quick Clean
1. Remove filter cartridges
2. Rinse with garden hose, rotating to spray between pleats
3. Reinstall

### Deep Clean (Recommended Monthly)
1. Remove filter cartridges
2. Prepare filter cleaner solution per product instructions
3. Soak filters for 8-24 hours
4. Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear
5. Allow to dry before reinstalling (optional)
6. Rotate filter positions on reinstall

### Replacement Schedule
- Replace filters every 1-2 years depending on use
- Replace immediately if: pleats torn, crushed, or discolored permanently

---

## Salt Cartridge Replacement (Every 4 Months)

### Signs Cartridge Needs Replacement
- System status shows cartridge expiration
- Unable to maintain chlorine even at max output
- Status reading stays in yellow/red left zone

### Procedure
1. Control panel will prompt when 4 months reached
2. Press soft button to initiate replacement process
3. Remove housing cap (located on bartop)
4. Press button on top of cartridge to release
5. Remove old cartridge
6. Insert new cartridge, press button to seat
7. Replace housing cap
8. Follow control panel prompts to confirm
9. System will restart and begin generation

### Notes
- Can postpone 7 days if prompted
- Old cartridge goes in regular trash
- Mark calendar for next replacement

---

## Weekly Shock Treatment

### Purpose
- Break down chloramines (combined chlorine)
- Oxidize organic waste
- Reactivate sanitizer

### Using Dichlor (Chlorine Shock)
1. Test current FAC
2. Add dichlor to reach 5 ppm FAC
3. Run clean cycle (jets on 10 min)
4. Leave cover off 20+ min to vent
5. Do not use spa until FAC drops below 5 ppm

### Using MPS (Non-Chlorine Shock)
1. Add ~5.5 TBSP MPS to filter compartment
2. Run clean cycle
3. MPS does not raise chlorine; spa usable sooner
4. Good for mid-week oxidation between chlorine shocks

## 10-Day System Check

### What Happens
- If output level not confirmed in 10 days, icon flashes
- After 15 days: auto-reduces to level 3
- After 20 days: auto-reduces to level 1

### Procedure
1. Test water with 5-way strip
2. Test salt level with salt strip
3. Verify all parameters in range
4. Adjust chemicals if needed
5. Confirm output level on control panel (press OK)
6. Timer resets

## Winterizing (Extended Absence in Freezing Weather)

**Use only if spa will be unattended in freezing conditions.**

### Equipment Needed
- Shop vac with blower function
- Propylene glycol antifreeze (RV type, non-toxic)
- Long-extension funnel
- Plywood sheets
- Tarp or plastic sheet

### Procedure
1. Drain spa completely (follow drain procedure)
2. Open waterfall valve, set diverters to middle
3. Remove and store filters in dry place
4. Use shop vac blower through filter opening to purge lines (3-5 min)
5. Switch to vacuum mode; vacuum all jet openings top to bottom
6. Vacuum filter suction fittings and drain outlet
7. Dry shell completely with towels
8. Pour propylene glycol into all standpipes, jet openings, waterfall openings
9. Replace drain cap
10. Close cover, fasten locks
11. Cover with plywood to distribute snow weight
12. Secure tarp over everything

### Spring Opening
1. Remove tarp and plywood
2. Refill following standard procedure (do not install filters yet)
3. Superchlorinate with 2x normal chlorine to destroy antifreeze
4. Add defoamer if needed
5. Drain completely
6. Install filters
7. Refill following fresh fill procedure

---

## Vacation Mode (3-14 days)

### Short Absence (3-5 days)
1. Test and balance pH
2. Shock to 5 ppm FAC
3. Set output level to maintain (may increase by 1)
4. Lock cover
5. On return: test and shock before use

### Extended Absence (5-14 days)
1. Day before leaving: lower temp to 80°F
2. Chlorine lasts longer in cooler water
3. Shock to 5 ppm FAC
4. Clean or replace filters
5. Set output level to 2 (vacation mode)
6. Lock cover
7. On return: shock, return temp to normal, test before use

### Over 14 Days
- Consider having someone check weekly
- Or winterize if freezing conditions possible
- Salt system alone cannot maintain indefinitely

## Vanishing Act Calcium Remover (If CH >75 ppm)

### When to Use
- Fill water CH >75 ppm
- CH has crept up over time
- Scale forming on surfaces

### Procedure
1. Rinse Vanishing Act pillow until water runs clear
2. Locate jet suction fitting (foot well area)
3. Access control panel: OPTIONS → Set-Up → More → Vanishing Act
4. Press to start 6-hour low-speed cycle
5. Place pillow firmly over suction fitting
6. Leave for 6 hours (jets will auto-run)
7. Test CH after cycle completes
8. If still >75 ppm, repeat with new pillow
9. Discard pillow in regular trash

### Notes
- Multiple pillows may be needed for very hard water
- Does not remove other minerals
- For CH >300 ppm, use On The Go portable softener during fill
