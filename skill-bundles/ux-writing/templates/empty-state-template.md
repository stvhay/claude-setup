## Content Patterns by Type

### First-Use (Onboarding)
**Pattern**: "No [content] yet. [Benefit statement]. [Action]"

Examples:

- "No favorites saved. Save items to find them quickly later. **Browse items**"
- "No team members yet. Invite people to collaborate on projects. **Invite team**"

### User-Cleared (Completion)
**Pattern**: "All [done/complete/caught up]. [Optional: when more appears]"

Examples:
- "All tasks complete. New tasks appear when teammates assign them to you."
- "Inbox zero! You've read all your messages."
- "You're all set. Check back tomorrow for new recommendations."

### No Results (Search/Filter)
**Pattern**: "No [content] match [criteria]. [Suggestion]. [Alternative]"

Examples:
- "No files match your search. Try different keywords or **view all files**."
- "No events this month. **See upcoming events** or **create an event**."
- "No team members match these filters. **Clear filters** to see all members."

### Permission/Access Required
**Pattern**: "[Content] isn't available. [Why]. [How to get access]"

Examples:

## Illustration Guidance

When working with designers on empty state illustrations:

**First-use**: Optimistic, inviting imagery (open boxes, blank canvases, starting points)
**User-cleared**: Positive, completion imagery (checkmarks, clean spaces, celebrations)
**No results**: Neutral, helpful imagery (search icons, magnifying glasses, directional arrows)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Negative framing**: "You have no contacts"
✅ **Neutral/positive**: "No contacts yet"

❌ **No guidance**: "Empty"
✅ **Actionable**: "No contacts yet. Import to get started."

❌ **Multiple CTAs**: Three different buttons competing
✅ **Single primary CTA**: One clear next action

❌ **Too much text**: Long paragraph explaining the feature
✅ **Concise**: One sentence benefit, clear button

❌ **Technical**: "No records found in database"
✅ **Human**: "No projects found"
