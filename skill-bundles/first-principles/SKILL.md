# First Principles Analysis

## Overview

Break problems down to their fundamental truths, question every assumption, and rebuild solutions unconstrained by convention.

Work through six phases, but within each phase, have a natural dialogue. Ask one question at a time, follow interesting threads, and don't rush to the next phase until the current one feels complete.

## When to Use This

- Existing solutions feel like cargo cult or "we've always done it this way"
- You hear "that's impossible" or "too expensive"
- Industry conventions don't make logical sense
- Need breakthrough rather than incremental improvement
- Something feels like inherited constraint vs actual constraint

## The Process

### Phase 1: Define the Problem

Don't skip this. Most failed analyses come from solving the wrong problem.

Start by understanding what we're actually trying to achieve. Ask questions like:

- What's the core problem in your own words?
- What would success look like concretely?
- Why does this problem exist?
- What prompted this now?

Stay here until the problem is crystal clear. If it feels fuzzy, keep asking.

### Phase 2: Surface Assumptions

Now list everything we're assuming - especially the "obvious" stuff that nobody questions.

Explore together:

- What do we assume to be true about this problem?
- What's "just how it's done" in this space?
- What would someone with zero context find strange?
- What constraints do we take for granted?

Present assumptions back conversationally: "So we're assuming X, Y, and Z - does that capture it, or is there more?"

### Phase 3: Question Each Assumption

This is the core of first principles. Take each assumption and interrogate it.

For each one, explore:

- Is this actually true? What's the evidence?
- Why do we believe this? Where did it come from?
- What if the opposite were true?
- Is this physics/logic, or just convention?

Have a genuine dialogue here. Some assumptions will survive scrutiny (those are fundamentals). Others will crumble (those were conventions masquerading as constraints).

Flag each as: **Fundamental** (keep) or **Convention** (question further)

### Phase 4: Identify Fundamentals

After the questioning, take stock of what remains. These are your building blocks.

Reflect together:

- What constraints are actually real?
- What requirements are truly non-negotiable?
- What's left when we strip away the conventions?

Present: "Here's what I see as the irreducible fundamentals: [list]. Does this feel right?"

Don't proceed until there's agreement on the foundation.

### Phase 5: Rebuild From Scratch

Now the creative part. Forget how it's currently done. Using ONLY the fundamentals, explore what's possible.

Guide the exploration:

- If we were starting fresh today, what would we build?
- How do completely different domains solve similar problems?
- What becomes possible now that we've dropped [convention]?

Propose 2-3 radically different approaches. Lead with your recommendation and reasoning, but present alternatives. Discuss trade-offs conversationally.

### Phase 6: Validate

Before committing, stress-test the new approach.

Explore:

- Does this actually solve the core problem from Phase 1?
- What new assumptions have we introduced?
- What could go wrong?
- Is this actually implementable?

Be willing to loop back if something doesn't hold up.

## Socratic Toolkit

Keep these in your back pocket for any phase:

| When you need to... | Ask...                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarify             | "What do you mean by...?" / "Can you give an example?"     |
| Challenge           | "What if that weren't true?" / "Who says?"                 |
| Probe evidence      | "How do we know?" / "Are there counterexamples?"           |
| Shift perspective   | "How would an outsider see this?" / "What's the opposite?" |
| Test consequences   | "What happens if...?" / "What could go wrong?"             |

## After the Analysis

**Document it:**

- Write to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-first-principles.md`
- Capture: problem, assumptions challenged, fundamentals, new approach
- Commit to git

**If implementing:**

- Create plan from the new mental model
- Watch for old assumptions creeping back in during implementation

---

## Key Principles

- **Question everything** - Especially the "obvious"
- **One question at a time** - Depth over breadth
- **Follow threads** - If something's interesting, explore it
- **Seek fundamentals** - Physics, logic, true requirements
- **Ignore convention** - "How it's done" isn't a reason
- **Validate rigorously** - New ideas need scrutiny Toolkit
