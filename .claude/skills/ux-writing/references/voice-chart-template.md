# Voice Chart Template

A voice chart helps establish consistent brand personality across all UX text. Use this template to define your product's voice.

1. **Concept** — A core brand principle or value
2. **Voice Characteristics** — Adjectives describing how the concept manifests in writing
3. **Examples** — Concrete do/don't pairs showing the voice in action

## Tips for Creating Your Voice Chart

1. **Base it on brand values** — Review mission, vision, values, and personality
2. **Use 3-5 concepts** — Enough to guide, not so many you can't remember
3. **Be specific with examples** — Show actual interface text, not abstract descriptions
4. **Test against real scenarios** — Apply to buttons, errors, and notifications
5. **Share with your team** — Voice only works if everyone uses it consistently
6. **Update as you learn** — Refine based on user research and team feedback
