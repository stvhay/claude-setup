# Content Usability Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate UX text quality. Rate each criterion 0-10.

## Concise

**Every word has a distinct job**
- No filler words like "basically", "actually", "just"
- Each word adds meaning or clarity
- Can't remove words without losing meaning

**High information density in minimal words**
- Maximum meaning per word
- Efficient phrasing
- No redundancy

**40-60 characters per line**
- Optimal line length for readability
- Breaks appropriately for scanning
- Not too long (causes focus loss) or too short (causes back-and-forth eye movement)

**Short sentences and paragraphs**
- Less than 3-4 lines per paragraph
- Sentences vary in length but average ~15-20 words
- Broken into scannable chunks

**Front-loaded with signal words**
- Most important words come first
- Action words at start of sentences
- Users see key information immediately

**Ideas ordered by priority**
- Most critical information first
- Secondary details follow
- Nice-to-know information last

## Scoring Guide

**9-10**: Excellent — Best practice example
**7-8**: Good — Minor improvements possible
**5-6**: Adequate — Notable issues to address
**3-4**: Needs work — Significant problems
**0-2**: Poor — Major revision required

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Review individual pieces** — Evaluate specific UI strings, messages, or flows
2. **Audit entire experiences** — Score major screens or user journeys
3. **Compare options** — Rate different versions to choose the best
4. **Track improvements** — Measure before and after edits
5. **Build rationale** — Use scores to explain writing decisions
6. **Focus efforts** — Identify lowest-scoring areas to improve first

## Example Evaluation

**Text**: "An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again."

**Concise**: 6/10 — Wordy, could be "We couldn't process your request. Try again."
**Purposeful**: 4/10 — Doesn't help user fix the problem or explain what happened
**Conversational**: 5/10 — Somewhat robotic, "an error occurred" is system-speak
**Clear**: 5/10 — Vague, doesn't specify what error or why

**Overall**: 5/10 — Adequate but needs significant improvement

**Improved**: "We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again."

**Concise**: 9/10 — Brief, direct, no wasted words
**Purposeful**: 8/10 — Suggests likely cause (connection) and next step
**Conversational**: 9/10 — Natural, human phrasing
**Clear**: 9/10 — Specific about what failed and what to do

**Overall**: 9/10 — Excellent
