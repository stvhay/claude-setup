# UX Writing

## Overview

Write clear, concise, user-centered interface copy.

**Core principle:** Every word must earn its place. Help users accomplish goals.

## When to Use

When writing or editing:
- Buttons, labels, titles
- Error messages, notifications, success messages
- Forms (labels, instructions, validation)
- Empty states, onboarding
- Any text users see in the interface

**Invoked by:** Other UX skills for copy refinement.

## Four Quality Standards

Every piece of UX text should be:

1. **Purposeful** — Helps users or business achieve goals
2. **Concise** — Fewest words without losing meaning
3. **Conversational** — Natural and human, not robotic
4. **Clear** — Unambiguous, accurate, easy to understand

## Quick Patterns

### Buttons
- Format: `[Verb] [object]` in sentence case
- ✓ "Save changes", "Delete account"
- ✗ "Submit", "OK", "Click here"

### Error Messages
- Format: `[What failed]. [Why/context]. [What to do].`
- ✓ "Payment failed. Card declined. Try a different payment method."
- ✗ "Error 403", "Invalid input"

### Success Messages
- Format: Past tense, specific
- ✓ "Changes saved", "Email sent"

### Empty States
- Format: Explanation + CTA
- ✓ "No messages yet. Start a conversation to connect with your team."

### Titles
- Format: Noun phrases, sentence case
- ✓ "Account settings", "Your library"

## Tone Adaptation

Voice is consistent personality. Tone adapts to context.

| User State | Tone | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| Frustrated | Empathetic, solution-focused | "Payment failed. Try a different method." |
| Confused | Patient, explanatory | "Connect your bank to see insights. We'll guide you." |
| Confident | Efficient, direct | "Saved" |
| Cautious | Serious, transparent | "Delete account? You'll lose all data." |

## Editing Process

1. **Purposeful** — Does it help the user?
2. **Concise** — Remove unnecessary words
3. **Conversational** — Would you say this aloud?
4. **Clear** — Is meaning unambiguous?

## Key Benchmarks

| Element | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Buttons | 2-4 words |
| Titles | 3-6 words, 40 chars max |
| Error messages | 12-18 words |
| Instructions | 20 words max |
| Sentence comprehension | 8 words = 100%, 14 words = 90% |
| Reading level | 7th-8th grade general, 10th professional |

## Accessibility

- Label all interactive elements explicitly
- Write descriptive link text (not "Click here")
- Don't rely on color alone
- Target 8-14 words per sentence
- Use plain language

## Common Mistakes

- Passive voice overuse
- Generic button labels ("Submit")
- Blaming users in errors
- Inconsistent terminology
- System-oriented language
- Relying on color alone
