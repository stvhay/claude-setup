## Analysis Guidance

For each controller in the safety control structure, document:

### 1. Responsibilities
List safety-related responsibilities relevant to this accident. Sources:
- Job descriptions
- SMS documentation
- Regulations
- What the controller believes their responsibilities are

### 2. Contribution to Hazardous State
Document actions or inactions that contributed to the accident.

**Do not use:**
- "Failed to..."
- "Should have..."
- "Negligently..."
- "Error"

**Use instead:**
- "Did not [action]"
- "[Action] was not taken"
- "[Condition] was not detected"

### 3. Why? (Contextual Factors)

This is the critical step most accident analyses skip. For each contribution, ask:

**Information available:**
- What information did they have?
- What information were they missing?
- Was the information correct?
- Was it presented in a usable form?

**Training and knowledge:**
- Did they have training for this situation?
- Was the training adequate for actual conditions?
- How often did they perform this task?

**Pressures and incentives:**
- What production/schedule pressures existed?
- What was the incentive structure?
- What were they rewarded/punished for?

**Competing demands:**
- What else was competing for attention?
- What other tasks were they responsible for?
- What was the workload?

**Procedures:**
- What procedures existed?
- Were they followable?
- Did they match actual conditions?
- Following Procedures Dilemma: If procedures were violated, was that to accomplish the task or avoid it?

**Design of work environment:**
- Did the interface support or hinder correct action?
- Were warnings/alarms meaningful or noise?
- Was critical information prominent?

### 4. Process/Mental Model Flaws

Document incorrect beliefs about:
- State of the controlled process
- How the process works
- What actions would have what effects
- What other controllers were doing
- What hazards existed

For each flaw, ask: Why did they have this incorrect model?
- Was correct information available?
- Was there feedback that should have corrected the model?
- Were assumptions from training still valid?

### 5. Summary and Recommendations

Synthesize the analysis:
- What was this component's role in the accident?
- What specific changes would prevent similar contribution?
- What questions remain unanswered?

## Example Questions by Controller Type

### Operators

- What was their training for this specific situation?
- How often had they performed this task before?
- What information was displayed to them?
- What alarms were active? Were they meaningful?
- What was their workload at the time?
- What procedures did they have? Were they accurate?
- What did they believe was happening?
- What pressures were they under?

### Operations Management

- What oversight did they provide of operator activities?
- What training did they ensure was completed?
- What procedures did they review/approve?
- What resources did they allocate to safety?
- What feedback did they receive about safety status?
- What did they believe about risk levels?
- What production pressures did they communicate?

### Engineering/Design

- What hazard analysis was performed during design?
- What assumptions were made about operating conditions?
- How was safety information communicated to operators?
- What feedback did they receive from operations?
- What changes were made after original design?
- Were safety assumptions revalidated after changes?

### Safety Management

- What hazard analysis methods were used?
- What risk assessments were performed?
- Were assumptions documented and tracked?
- What safety information system exists?
- How is learning from incidents captured?
- What audits were performed?
- What leading indicators were monitored?

### Executive Management

- What safety policy exists?
- How is safety balanced against other goals?
- What resources are allocated to safety?
- What feedback do they receive about safety status?
- What incentives exist for safety performance?
- What safety culture do their actions demonstrate?

### Regulators

- What was their oversight scope?
- What inspections were performed?
- What deficiencies were identified?
- Were deficiencies corrected?
- What resources did they have for oversight?
- What was their model of the organization's safety status?

## Common Contextual Factors

### Information Problems
- Information existed but wasn't communicated
- Information was communicated but not in usable form
- Information was drowned in noise
- Critical information was not distinguishable from routine

### Procedure Problems
- Procedures didn't exist for the situation
- Procedures existed but weren't followed (ask why)
- Procedures were followed but were wrong
- Procedures conflicted with each other

### Training Problems
- Training was inadequate for actual conditions
- Training was on different equipment/version
- Training didn't cover this scenario
- Training occurred long ago without refresher

### Resource Problems
- Insufficient staff
- Insufficient time
- Insufficient equipment
- Insufficient budget

### Pressure Problems
- Production pressure
- Schedule pressure
- Peer pressure
- Self-imposed pressure to perform

## Avoiding Hindsight Bias

After you know the outcome, ask:
- Without knowing the outcome, would I have seen this as significant?
- What else was competing for attention?
- How many other items had the same apparent priority?
- What would a reasonable person in that position have done?

Clues you're succumbing to hindsight bias:
- Using "should have"
- Finding behavior "obviously" wrong
- Not explaining why the behavior seemed correct at the time
