# Systemic Factors Analysis

Systemic factors affect multiple or all components of the safety control structure simultaneously. This is what traditional event-chain models miss.

## Communication and Coordination

### Designed Channels
- Were necessary communication channels designed into the system?
- Were responsibilities for communication clearly assigned?
- Were there mechanisms to confirm messages received and understood?

### Operational Status
- Were designed channels working at time of accident?
- If down, was there notification/contingency?
- Were backup communication methods available?

### Between-Level Communication
- Was feedback reaching higher levels?
- Was it filtered or distorted?
- Were control actions reaching lower levels clearly?

### Peer Communication
- Did controllers at same level communicate?
- Were there coordination mechanisms?
- Were conflicting directions identified and resolved?

### Responsibility Overlaps
- When multiple controllers share responsibility, who actually acts?
- Did each assume the other was handling it?
- Were overlapping responsibilities explicit?

**Visualization:** Draw communication channels as designed, then annotate which were operating at time of accident.

## Safety Information System

A SIS stores and retrieves information needed for safety decision-making.

### Collection
- What safety-relevant information is collected?
- Is it collected consistently?
- Is there filtering or suppression?
- Are near-misses captured?
- Are systemic factors captured (not just proximate events)?

### Storage
- Is information stored in retrievable form?
- Is it searchable?
- Is it complete or summarized?
- Are trends detectable?

### Retrieval and Use
- Can people find what they need?
- Is it presented usefully for decision-making?
- Is it integrated into daily work?
- Is there time to use it?

### Update
- Is information updated as system changes?
- Are hazard analyses updated after modifications?
- Are assumptions revalidated?

### Common Deficiencies
- Data collected but never analyzed
- Analysis done but not communicated
- Communication exists but not in usable form
- Information exists but hard to find
- Past events not connected to current decisions

## Safety Culture

Safety culture = values and assumptions actually used in safety-related decisions (not espoused values).

### Culture Types to Diagnose

**Risk Acceptance Culture**
- "Accidents are inevitable"
- "Accidents are price of productivity"
- "Everyone should just be careful"

**Denial Culture**
- Risk assessments unrealistically low
- Warnings dismissed without investigation
- Focus on proving safety rather than finding hazards

**Compliance Culture**
- Focus on meeting minimum requirements
- Regulatory compliance substitutes for safety
- Paperwork production without impact

**Paperwork Culture**
- Extensive documentation with little effect on practice
- Safety group disconnected from operations
- Documents produced to be filed, not used

### Culture Indicators

Look at actual behavior, not survey responses:
- How are safety concerns treated when raised?
- Are near-misses investigated seriously?
- Are safety recommendations implemented?
- How are conflicts between safety and production resolved?
- What gets rewarded and punished?
- Where does safety fit in resource allocation?

### Leadership Indicators
- Does top management visibly prioritize safety?
- Are safety decisions made at appropriate level?
- Do safety staff have authority to stop operations?
- Are safety staff rewarded/promoted?

## Safety Management System Design

### Responsibility Assignment
- Are all necessary responsibilities assigned?
- Is authority matched to responsibility?
- Is there accountability?
- Are there gaps?
- Are there conflicts?

### Hazard Analysis
- What methods are used?
- Are they appropriate for system complexity?
- Are they actually performed?
- Are results used in decision-making?

### Management of Change
- Is there a MOC process?
- Is it followed?
- Does it cover all types of changes?
- Does it trigger assumption revalidation?

### Auditing
- What is audited?
- How often?
- By whom?
- What happens with findings?
- Are systemic issues identified?

### Incident Investigation
- What triggers investigation?
- What methods are used?
- Are systemic factors considered?
- Are recommendations implemented?
- Is effectiveness verified?

## Changes and Dynamics

### Planned Changes
- What changes occurred before accident?
- Was MOC process followed?
- Were assumptions revalidated?
- Was hazard analysis updated?

### Unplanned Changes
- What changed without formal recognition?
- Did procedures drift from design?
- Did responsibilities shift informally?
- Did equipment degrade?

### Slow Drift
- What changed gradually over time?
- Were leading indicators tracking drift?
- Was there complacency from success?
- Were past assumptions still valid?

### Risk Perception
- Did risk perception match actual risk?
- Did success create overconfidence?
- Were near-misses treated as warnings or luck?

### Common Change Patterns
- System worked initially, then changed
- People left, taking knowledge with them
- Workload increased without resources
- Success reduced perceived need for safety measures
- Economics changed (competition, budget cuts)

## Economic and Environmental Factors

### Internal Economics
- Budget pressures
- Profit pressures
- Cost-cutting initiatives
- Resource constraints

### External Economics
- Market competition
- Regulatory changes
- Industry consolidation
- Economic downturns

### Environmental Changes
- Population growth near facilities
- Land use changes
- New technologies
- Workforce demographics

### Technology Changes
- Automation introduction
- System complexity increase
- Interface changes
- Integration of new components

## Synthesis Questions

After reviewing systemic factors:
- Which factors affected multiple components?
- Which were known before the accident?
- Which were detectable?
- What would it take to address each factor?
- What leading indicators could track these factors?
