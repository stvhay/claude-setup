# Red Team Integration Guide

## Skill Integration Order

**Use BEFORE RedTeam:**
- `research` - Gather context, find precedents

**Use DURING RedTeam:**
- Deep decomposition of arguments
- Parallel assault from multiple perspectives

**Use AFTER RedTeam:**
- Extract highest-signal critiques
- Share findings for discussion

## FirstPrinciples Integration

RedTeam deeply integrates with FirstPrinciples thinking:

- **Phase 1 Enhancement:** Use first-principles deconstruction to break arguments into fundamental parts
- **Phase 5 Enhancement:** Classify constraints as hard/soft/assumption
- **Core Insight:** The most devastating critiques come from challenging hidden assumptions
- **Key question:** "What assumptions are being treated as hard constraints that are actually choices?"

## Output Format

- **Format:** Steelman + Counter-argument, each with 8 numbered points
- **Length:** 12-16 words per point (strict discipline)
- **Tone:** Direct, substantive, non-performative
- **Must Include:** First-principles analysis, convergence identification
- **Must Avoid:** Nitpicking, strawmanning, generic objections
