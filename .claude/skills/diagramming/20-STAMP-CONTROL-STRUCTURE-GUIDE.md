# STAMP Control Structure Diagrams

Generate DOT/Graphviz diagrams for STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) analysis.

## When to Use

This guide applies when creating diagrams for:
- STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) - prospective hazard analysis
- CAST (Causal Analysis based on System Theory) - retrospective incident analysis
- STPA-Sec - security-focused control analysis
- Any control structure, feedback loop, or causal scenario diagram

## Quick Reference

| Diagram Type | Layout | Key Convention |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Control structure | `rankdir=TB` | Solid=control, dashed=feedback |
| Routing/decision | `rankdir=TB` | Diamond=decision, colored boxes=outcomes |
| Causal scenario | `rankdir=LR` | Octagon=hazard, red=loss |
