# superpowers

A personal collection of Claude Code skills, built on
[Jesse Vincent's superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

I'm reshaping my own ideas into the skills framework to see what emerges.
A workshop, not a product.

## What's here

Skills cluster around:

- **Development workflow** - TDD, debugging, code review, git worktrees,
  verification before completion
- **Agentic UX** - Delegation, approval, graceful failure, trust calibration
- **Planning** - Brainstorming ideas into designs, writing plans,
  dispatching parallel agents
- **Safety analysis** - STAMP/STPA methods for hazards and controls
- **Writing** - Clear prose, UX microcopy
- **Tool integrations** - Obsidian markdown, JSON Canvas

The skills are opinionated. They encode workflows I find useful, not
universal best practices.

## Using this

Clone it, steal from it, ignore it. The skills live in `.claude/skills/`.
